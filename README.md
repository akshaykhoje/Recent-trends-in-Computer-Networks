# UCS1511-ComputerNetworks-Labwork

Programs, reports, documentation and screenshots implemented and designed for the laboratory coursework in `UCS1511: Computer Networks` 

## Experiments

1. [Theoretical Study](./Ex1-TheoreticStudy)
    - Study the basic network commands in GNU systems.
    - Study the common system calls in the C language.
    - [Network Commands in *nix](./Ex1-TheoreticStudy/A_NetworkCommands.pdf)
    - [System Calls in C](./Ex1-TheoreticStudy/B_SystemCalls.pdf)
