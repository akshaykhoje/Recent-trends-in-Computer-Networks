```

Simple code for testing

```
from mininet.topo import Topo
from mininet.net import Mininet

class SimpleTopology(Topo):
    def init(self):
        Topo.init(self)

        switch = self.addSwitch('s1')
        host1 = self.addHost('h1')
        host2 = self.addHost('h2')
        
        self.addLink(host1, switch)
        self.addLink(host2, switch)

topo = SimpleTopology()
net = Mininet(topo=topo)
net.start()
net.pingAll()
net.stop()
